# GetTwitchClips

THIS REPO HAS DEPENDENCIES, THAT HAVE DANGEROUS ISSUES.. THAT ALSO DONT GET UPDATED VERY OFTEN, THIS IS ARCHIVED.
BELOW, YOU CAN SEE THE REASON AND THE THINGS WE FOUND WITH THIS CODE.

This is code aims to automate a workflow in which, clips are downloaded from a popular streamer on twitch, then uploaded to a youtube channel, which people with dedication to these streamers often do by hand.
This is a cheeky method to (basically) get money from doing nothing..  (only worked around june 2021)
People knew even the manual way was cheeky, since you'd just repost clips from streamers, but we made it even easier, Our highest peak subscruier count using this code.. was: 2419 subscribers.
